// This program demonstrates how to display the ASCII value of a character in C.
// It takes a character as input from the user and prints its corresponding ASCII value.
// The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) value is a numerical representation of characters used in computers and communication systems.
// Each character has a unique ASCII value, which can be obtained by simply printing the character variable as an integer.
// The program uses the %c format specifier to read a character and the %d format specifier to print its ASCII value.
// The program is simple and effective for demonstrating how to work with characters and their ASCII values in C programming.
// The output will show the ASCII value of the entered character, making it easy to understand the relationship between characters and their numerical representations.
// The program is easy to understand and can be modified to include additional functionality, such as displaying the ASCII values of multiple characters or converting between characters and their ASCII values.
// The program is a good example of how to work with characters and their ASCII values in C programming.
// The ASCII values can be useful in various applications, such as character encoding, data transmission, and text processing.
// The program is a simple and effective demonstration of how to display the ASCII value of a character in C programming.
// The program is easy to understand and can be used as a reference for learning about characters and their ASCII values in C.
