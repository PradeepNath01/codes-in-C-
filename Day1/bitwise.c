// This program demonstrates the use of bitwise operators in C.
// It performs various bitwise operations on two integers, a and b, and prints the results.
// The bitwise operators used include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).
// The program initializes a and b with values 5 and 3, respectively, and then applies the bitwise operators to them.
// The results of each operation are printed to the console, showing how the bitwise operators manipulate the binary representations of the numbers.
// The output will display the results of the bitwise operations, including the values of a and b, and the results of each operation.
// The program is a simple and effective demonstration of bitwise operations in C programming.
// The bitwise operators are useful for low-level programming tasks, such as manipulating bits in binary data.
// The program can be modified to work with different integer values or to include additional bitwise operations.
// The use of bitwise operators is common in systems programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
// The program is a good example of how to use bitwise operators in C programming.
// The bitwise operators allow for efficient manipulation of binary data, making them a powerful tool in C programming.
// The program is easy to understand and can be used as a reference for learning about bitwise operations in C.
// The output will show the results of the bitwise operations, including the values of a and b, and the results of each operation.
